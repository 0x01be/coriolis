Release Notes
=============

Release 1.0.1475
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first preliminary release of the |Coriolis2| framework.

This release mainly ships the global router |Knik| and the detailed router
|Kite|. Together they aim to replace the |Alliance| |Nero| router.
Unlike |Nero|, |Kite| is based on an innovating routing modeling and ad-hoc
algorithm. Although it is released under |GPL| license, the source code
will be avalaible later.
|medskip|


|noindent| Contents of this release:

1. A graphical user interface (viewer only).
2. The |Knik| global router.
3. The |Kite| detailed router.

|noindent| Supported input/output formats:

* |Alliance| |vst| (netlist) & |ap| (physical) formats.
* Even if there are some references to the |Cadence| |LEFDEF| format, its
  support is not included because it depends on a library only available
  to |Si2| affiliated members.

   As a consequence, we drop the distribution packaging support and give
   public read-only access to the repository.
#. Deep rewrite of the |Katabatic| database and |Kite| detailed router,
   achieve a speedup factor greater than 20...


Release v2.1

   |Etesian| and its legalization and detailed placement tools.
#. Added a Blif format parser to process circuits generated by the Yosys and ABC
   logic synthetizers.
#. The multiples user defined configuration files are now grouped under
   a common hidden (dot) directory ``.coriolis2`` and the file extension
   is back from ``.conf`` to ``.py``.

.. #. Under |RHEL7| / |SL7|, there is a known bug in the graphical visualizer.
..    When shifting to the left, the right-half part of the screen gets
..    badly redrawn. Uses |CTRL_L| to refresh. It will be corrected as soon
..    as possible.

#. Added JSON import/export of the whole Hurricane DataBase. Two save mode
   are supported: *Cell* mode (standalone) or *Blob* mode, which dump the
