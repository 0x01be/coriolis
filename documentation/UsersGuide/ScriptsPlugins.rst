.. _Python Interface to Coriolis:

Python Interface for |Hurricane| / |Coriolis|
=============================================

The (almost) complete interface of |Hurricane| is exported as a |Python| module
and some part of the other components of |Coriolis| (each one in a separate
module). The interface has been made to mirror as closely as possible the
C++ one, so the C++ doxygen documentation could be used to write code with
either languages.

`Summary of the C++ Documentation <file:../../../index.html>`_

A script could be run directly in text mode from the command line or through
the graphical interface (see :ref:`Python Scripts in Cgt`).

Asides for this requirement, the python script can contain anything valid
in |Python|, so don't hesitate to use any package or extention.

Small example of Python/Stratus script: ::

    from Hurricane import *
    from Stratus   import *

    def doSomething ():
        # ...
        return

    def ScriptMain ( **kw ):
      editor = None
      if kw.has_key('editor') and kw['editor']:
        editor = kw['editor']
        stratus.setEditor( editor )

      doSomething()
      return
    
    if __name__ == "__main__" :
      kw           = {}
      success      = ScriptMain( **kw )
      shellSuccess = 0
      if not success: shellSuccess = 1
      
      sys.exit( shellSuccess )
          ScriptMain ()

This typical script can be executed in two ways:

#. Run directly as a |Python| script, thanks to the ::

     if __name__ == "__main__" :

   part (this is standart |Python|). It is a simple adapter that will
   calls  :cb:`ScriptMain()`.
#. Through |cgt|, either in text or graphical mode. In that case, the
   :cb:`ScriptMain()` is directly called trough a sub-interpreter.
   The arguments of the script are passed through the ``**kw`` dictionnary.

   |                      | on the context, it may be ``None``.           |
   |                      | For example, when run from |cgt|, it the cell |
   |                      | currently loaded in the viewer, if any.       |
   +----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | ``'editor'``         | The viewer from which the script is run, when |
   |                      | lauched through |cgt|.                        |
   +----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+


Plugins
~~~~~~~

Plugins are |Python| scripts specially crafted to integrate with |cgt|.
Their entry point is a :cb:`ScriptMain()` method as described in 
`Python Interface to Coriolis`_. They can be called by user scripts
through this method.



Chip Placement
--------------

Automatically perform the placement of a complete chip. This plugin, as well
as the other P&R tools expect a specific top-level hierarchy for the design.
The top-level hierarchy must contains the instances of all the I/O pads and
**exactly one** instance of the chip's core model.

|bcenter| |ChipStructure-1| |ecenter|

The designer must provide a configuration file that define the rules for the
placement of the top-level hierarchy (that is, the pads and the core).
This file must be named after the chip's name, by appending ``_chip.py``
(obviously, it is a |Python| file). For instance if the chip netlist file
is called ``amd2901_crl.vst``, then the configuration file must be named
``amd2901_crl_chip.vst``.

Example of chip placement configuration file (for ``AM2901``): ::

    chip = \
      { 'pads.south'     : [ 'p_a3'     , 'p_a2'     , 'p_a1'     , 'p_r0'
                           , 'p_vddick0', 'p_vssick0', 'p_a0'     , 'p_i6'
                           , 'p_i8'     , 'p_i7'     , 'p_r3'     ]
      , 'pads.east'      : [ 'p_zero'   , 'p_i0'     , 'p_i1'     , 'p_i2'
                           , 'p_vddeck0', 'p_vsseck0', 'p_q3'     , 'p_b0'
                           , 'p_b1'     , 'p_b2'     , 'p_b3'     ]
      , 'pads.north'     : [ 'p_noe'    , 'p_y3'     , 'p_y2'     , 'p_y1'
                           , 'p_y0'     , 'p_vddeck1', 'p_vsseck1', 'p_np'
                           , 'p_ovr'    , 'p_cout'   , 'p_ng'     ]
      , 'pads.west'      : [ 'p_cin'    , 'p_i4'     , 'p_i5'     , 'p_i3'
                           , 'p_ck'     , 'p_d0'     , 'p_d1'     , 'p_d2'
                           , 'p_d3'     , 'p_q0'     , 'p_f3'     ]
      , 'core.size'      : ( 1500, 1500 )
      , 'chip.size'      : ( 3000, 3000 )
      , 'chip.clockTree' : True
      }

The file must contain *one dictionnary* named ``chip``.

.. note::
   If no clock tree is generated, then the clock rail is *not* created.
   So even if the requested number of rails ``chip.block.rails.count`` is, say 5,
   only four rails (2* ``power``, 2* ``ground``) will be generateds.


Clock Tree
----------

Insert a clock tree into a block. The clock tree uses the H strategy.
The clock net is splitted into sub-nets, one for each branch of the
tree.

* On **chips** design, the sub-nets are createds in the model of the
  core block (then trans-hierarchically flattened to be shown at
  chip level).
* On **blocks**, the sub nets are created directly in the top block.
* The sub-nets are named according to a simple geometrical scheme.
  A common prefix ``ck_htree``, then one postfix by level telling
  on which quarter of plane the sub-clock is located:

  #. ``_bl``: bottom left plane quarter.
  #. ``_br``: bottom right plane quarter.
  #. ``_tl``: top left plane quarter.
  #. ``_tr``: top right plane quarter.

  We can have ``ck_htree_bl``, ``ck_htree_bl_bl``, ``ch_htree_bl_tl`` and so on.

The clock tree plugin works in four steps:

#. Build the clock tree: creates the top-block abutment box, compute the
   levels of H tree neededs and place the clock buffers.
#. Once the clock buffers are placed, calls the placer (|etesian|) to place
   the ordinary standart cells, whithout disturbing clock H-tree buffers.
#. At this point we know the exact positions of all the DFFs, so we can
   connect them to the nearest H-tree leaf clock signal.
#. Leaf clock signals that are not connecteds to any DFFs are removed.

Netlist reorganisation:

* Obviously the top block or chip core model netlist is modificated to
  contains all the clock sub-nets. The interface is *not* changed.
* If the top block contains instances of other models *and* those models
  contains DFFs that get re-connecteds to the clock sub-nets (from the
  top level). Change both the model netlist and interface to propagate
  the relevant clock sub-nets to the instanciated model. The new model
  with the added clock signal is renamed with a ``_clocked`` suffix.
  For example, the sub-block model ``ram.vst`` will become ``ram_clocked.vst``.

.. note::
  If you are to re-run the clock tree plugin on a netlist, be careful
  to erase any previously generated ``_clocked`` file (both netlist and
  layout: ``rm *.clocked.{ap,vst}``). And restart |cgt| to clear it's
  memory cache.

Configuration parameters, defaults are defined in ``etc/coriolis2/<STECHNO>/plugins.conf``.

Recursive-Save (RSave)
----------------------

Perform a recursive top down save of all the models from the top cell
loaded in |cgt|. Force a write of any non-terminal model. This plugin is used
by the clock tree plugin after the netlist clock sub-nets creation.


A Simple Example: AM2901
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To illustrate the capabilities of |Coriolis| tools and |Python| scripting, a small
example, derived from the |Alliance| :cb:`AM2901` is supplied.

This example contains only the synthetized netlists and the :cb:`doChip.py` script
which perform the whole P&R of the design.

You can generate the chip using one of the following method:

#. **Command line mode:** directly run the script: ::

    dummy@lepka:AM2901$ ./doChip -V --cell=amd2901

#. **Graphic mode:** launch |cgt|, load chip netlist ``amd2901`` (the top cell)
   then run the |Python| script :cb:`doChip.py`.

.. note::
   Between two consecutive run, be sure to erase the netlist/layout generateds: ::

       dummy@lepka:AM2901$ rm *_clocked*.vst *.ap
