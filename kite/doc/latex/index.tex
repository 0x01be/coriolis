This documentation adresses two level of explanations \-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\bfseries A\-P\-I} description which explains how to use \hyperlink{namespaceKite}{Kite}, thoses parts as flagged as {\bfseries A\-P\-I}. 
\item The internal description which details how \hyperlink{namespaceKite}{Kite} do things. It's mostly intended for myself to help me not to forget how I've done things when debug time will come... It may also be valuable to people who may want to use or patch \hyperlink{namespaceKite}{Kite} for their own purpose (my secret hope).
