Coriolis is a free database, placement tool and routing tool for VLSI designs.

Purpose
=======

Coriolis provides several tools to perform the layout of VLSI circuits.
Its main components are the Hurricane database, the Etesian placer and the Kite router,
but other tools can use the Hurricane database and the parsers provided.

The user interface cgt is the prefered way to use Coriolis, but all
Coriolis tools are python modules and thus scriptable.

Documentation
=============

The full documentation is available [online](https://soc-extras.lip6.fr/en/coriolis/coriolis2-users-guide/) and, once built, as documentation/UsersGuide/UsersGuide.html. Basic build instructions are given below.
