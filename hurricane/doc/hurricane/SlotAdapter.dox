  *  \section      sInspectorIntro  Introduction
  *
  *                The Hurricane Database provide a generic mechanism to allow
  *                the inspection of the whole data structure at run-time.
  *                The associated window/tool is called "The Inspector".
  *
  *                In this section, we  will describe how the inspection
  *                mechanism to new objects.
  *
  *
  * \subsection    ssSlotAdapter  The SlotAdapter
  *
  *                First, we introduce the SlotAdapter object. Any inspectable
  *                object has to be associated (see the next section) with a
  *                SlotAdapter. It's providing the following methods :
\code
class SlotAdapter {
  public:
           virtual string  _GetTypename     () const;
           virtual string  _GetString       () const;
           virtual Record* _GetRecord       () const;
    inline virtual Slot*   _GetSlot         ( const string& name ) const;
};
\endcode
  *
  *                
  *                Thoses methods correspond to :
  *                <ul>
  *                  <li>\b _GetTypeName() : the inspected object's type.
  *                  <li>\b _GetString() : a synthetic string description of the
  *                      object's state.
  *                  <li>\b _GetRecord() : the complete description of all object's
  *                      attributes (a list of Slot).
  *                  <li>\b _GetSlot() : a Slot build from this SlotAdapter. As this
  *                      function is supplied by default with the right implementation
  *                      we will not detail it here.
  *                </ul>
  *
  *
  * \subsection    ssObjectTypology  Typology of inspectables objects
  *
  *                We distinguish three kind of objects, corresponding to three
  *                different ways of association to a SlotAdapter.
  *                <ul>
  *                  <li><b>User defined, with virtual methods</b> : those objects
  *                      must inherit from the NestedSlotAdapter class.
  *                  <li><b>User defined, without virtual methods</b> : thoses
  *                      objects must provides (as ordinary methods)
  *                      \b _GetTypeName() , \b _GetString() , \b _GetRecord() .
  *                      But \b not \b _GetSlot().
  *                  <li><b>External objects</b> : that is, we cannot modify.
  *                      In this case we have to provide a specialised template
  *                      overload for \b ProxyTypeName<>() , \b ProxyString<>() ,
  *                      and \b ProxyRecord<>() (see \ref ssExternalObjects).
  *                </ul>
  *
  *
  * \subsection    ssUserDefinedVirtual  User Defined Object with virtual methods
  *
  *                This approach should be preferrred for complex objects
  *                that are persistents in memory.
  *
  *                Example of implementation :
\code
namespace MyTool {
  class MyClass : public NestedSlotAdapter {
     protected:
       int  _value;
     public:
               int     GetValue    () const { return _value; }
       virtual string  _GetTypeName() const { return "MyClass"; };
       virtual string  _GetString  () const { return "<MyClass"+GetString(_value)+">"; };
       virtual Record* _GetRecord  () const;
  };

  Record* MyClass::GetRecord () const {
    Record* record = new Record(_GetString());
    record->Add ( GetSlot("_value",&_value) );
    return record;
  }
} // End of MyTool namespace.

SetNestedSlotAdapter(MyTool::MyClass)
\endcode
  *
  *                \e MyClass derives from NestedSlotAdapter. Any derived class of
  *                \e MyClass will inherit of it, so you do not have to (and musn't)
  *                repeat the inheritance from NestedSlotAdapter.
  *                
  *                \e SetNestedSlotAdapter() must be put outside any namespace.
  *
  *                \e SetNestedSlotAdapter() must never be called on objects that do
  *                not derives from NestedSlotAdapter. There's builtin safety :
  *                a \c static_cast into NestedSlotAdapter that will make the
  *                compiler fail.
  *
  *                \e SetNestedSlotAdapter() may be omitted, at the cost of generating
  *                a intermediary SlotAdapter (that will cost two pointers). Nevertheless
  *                it will work.
  *
  *
  * \subsection    ssUserDefinedWithoutVirtual  User Defined Object without virtual methods
  *
  *                This implementation should be preferred for light objects
  *                that are instanciated in vast amounts (we gain the \e vtable
  *                pointer over the previous approach).
  *
  *                Example of implementation :
\code
namespace MyTool {
  class MyLightClass {
     protected:
       int  _value;
     public:
       int     GetValue    () const { return _value; }
       string  _GetTypeName() const { return "MyLightClass"; };
       string  _GetString  () const { return "<MyLightClass"+GetString(_value)+">"; };
       Record* _GetRecord  () const;
  };

  Record* MyLightClass::GetRecord () const {
    Record* record = new Record(_GetString());
    record->Add ( GetSlot("_value",&_value) );
    return record;
  }
} // End of MyTool namespace.
\endcode
  *
  *                The methods \b _GetTypeName() , \b _GetString() and \b GetRecord()
  *                are now non-virtual and there's no call to \b SetNestedSlotAdapter() .
  *
  *
  * \subsection    ssExternalObjects  External Objects
  *
  *                This is the implementation to uses for managing objects
  *                from other libraries that we should want to browse in the
  *                Inspector. In this case we have to provide three overload
  *                of template functions, as shown below (for boolean type) :
\code
template<>
  inline string  ProxyTypeName<bool> ( const bool* object ) { return "<PointerSlotAdapter<bool>>"; }

template<>
  inline string  ProxyString<bool>   ( const bool* object ) { return (*object)?"True":"False" ; }

template<>
  inline Record* ProxyRecord<bool>   ( const bool* object ) { return NULL; }
\endcode
  *
  *
  * \section       sGetStringAndGetSlot  GetString() and GetSlot() functions
  *
  *                When a class or type is provided with Inspector support,
  *                you may uses the two generic functions below :
\code
template<typename T> inline string            GetString ( T* t );
template<typename T> inline string            GetString ( T  t );
template<typename T> inline Hurricane::Slot*  GetSlot ( const string& name, T* t );
template<typename T> inline Hurricane::Slot*  GetSlot ( const string& name, T  t );
\endcode
  *
  *                GetString() may be used to print some debugging informations
  *                on \stdout.
  *
  *                GetSlot() used to built the various entries in a \b _GetRecord()
  *                method.
  *
  *                <b>Argument type policy</b>
  *
  *                As you noticed there are two overload for each function,
  *                one with pointer argument, the other with a value argument.
  *                This is meaningful :
  *                <ul>
  *                  <li>Passing by pointer means that the data being inspected
  *                      is persistent, and should not be deleted once the
  *                      inspector is closed. This is the case of all DBo
  *                      objects and, for example, Box objects when they are
  *                      attributes of another object.
  *                  <li>Passing by value, means that the data is volatile and
  *                      should be deleted at the inspector closing. As an
  *                      example, the bounding box of an instance which is
  *                      computed on the fly, we must copy the result into
  *                      the SlotAdapter but no longer need it afterwards.
  *                      An important consequence is that thoses objects
  *                      must have a valid copy constructor.
  *                </ul>
  *
  *                <b>Default type support</b>
  *
  *                Hurricane provide support for the following types :
  *                <ul>
  *                  <li><b>const char</b>
  *                  <li><b>const char*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const string*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const bool*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const void*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const int*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const long*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const unsigned int*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const unsigned long*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const unsigned long long*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const unsigned short int*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const float*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const double*</b>
  *                </ul>
  *                Note that, as long as the pointer type is supported, the value
  *                is also (except for the \b char type which has a somewhat more
  *                complex behavior).
  *
  *                It also provide support for the following \STL containers :
  *                <ul>
  *                  <li><b>const vector<Element>*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const list<Element>*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const map<Key,Element,Compare>*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const set<Element,Compare>*</b>
  *                  <li><b>const multiset<Element,Compare>*</b>
  *                </ul>
  *
  *
  * \section       sIOStreamSupport  Support for iostream
  *
  *                If an object (with inspector support) is often printed into
  *                a stream, you may define an overload of \b operator<<() with
  *                either the \b PointerIOStreamSupport() or \b ValueIOStreamSupport()
  *                macros. The macros must in the top-level namespace.
  *
  *
  * \section       sLastNote  A note for myself
  *
  *                About the deletion mechanism : there are two level of deletion,
  *                the SlotAdapter deletion and the object deletion.
  *
  *                Object deletion is managed by the SlotAdapter : if the SlotAdapter
  *                is nested in the object, do not delete, otherwise delete.
  *
  *                SlotAdapter deletion is managed at Slot level : if the object
  *                is passed by pointer, do not delete the SlotAdapter. if the object
  *                is passed by value, delete the SlotAdapter.
