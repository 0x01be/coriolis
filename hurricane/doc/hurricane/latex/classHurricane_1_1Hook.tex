\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Hook}{Hook} description ({\bfseries A\-P\-I}) 

\hypertarget{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookIntro}{}\subsection{Introduction}\label{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookIntro}
The hook is an object which is nested inside a component and which represents some specific part of this component (like its body, its origin or its extremity ...).

The \hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Hook}{Hook} class is an abstract one, that means that for any new type of {\bfseries part} a new hook subclass must be derived. Each hook specialization will be described altogether with the component which includes it.

The \hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Component}{Component} for instance introduces the concept of {\bfseries Body\-Hook} representing the body of the component (which can be assimilated to the component itself).\hypertarget{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookRings}{}\subsection{Rings}\label{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookRings}
Hooks are assembled into a {\bfseries ring} (circular link) thanks to a special field pointing to the next hook within the ring.

This field is never N\-U\-L\-L, by default it points to itself, generating a minimal ring.\hypertarget{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookMasterAndSlaveHookTypes}{}\subsection{Master and Slave hook types}\label{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookMasterAndSlaveHookTypes}
There are two kinds of hooks \-: the {\bfseries masters} and the {\bfseries slaves}.

Rings are organized such that all slave hooks of a master hook are placed in the ring immediately before it (the ordering of slaves is not significant).

Therefore, to find the master of a given slave, it's enough to follow the ring pointers, starting from the slave, until a master is found.\hypertarget{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookExplicitConnections}{}\subsection{Explicit connections}\label{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookExplicitConnections}
This dependency between a slave and its master means that the part of the component represented by the slave is anchored on the part of the component represented by the master.

This dependence relationship is indeed an explicit connection.\hypertarget{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookImplicitConnections}{}\subsection{Implicit connections}\label{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookImplicitConnections}
Within a ring many relationships master-\/slaves can cohabit.

This cohabitation has a specific meaning for the different masters of the ring. In fact, the ring must be considered as a connection request between the different masters of the ring.

In other words, this means that the different masters remains to be connected together, or more generaly stated, that the different connected subsets of components associated to those masters remains to be connected together.

The ordering of masters within a ring has no particular signification.\hypertarget{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookConceptsOfHyperhooksAndHyperrings}{}\subsection{Concepts of Hyper\-Hooks and Hyper\-Rings}\label{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookConceptsOfHyperhooksAndHyperrings}
We can imagine the master-\/slaves relation as a kind of hyper-\/hook representing the associated sub-\/ring, and the ring containing multiple master-\/slaves relations as an hyper-\/ring made up of hyper-\/hooks needing to be connected.

Therefore there will be two different levels of ring processing functions depending on wether we handle hooks stricktly speaking or we handle hyper-\/hooks representing multiple master hooks.\hypertarget{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookConstructorAndDestructor}{}\subsection{Constructor and Destructor}\label{classHurricane_1_1Hook_secHookConstructorAndDestructor}
There is no \hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Hook}{Hook} constructor available because they are created by the components themselves.

On the same way, hooks disapear automatically with their owner.
