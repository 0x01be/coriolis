Register a static initialization function. 

\hypertarget{classInitializer_secInitializerMechanism}{}\subsection{Initializer Mechanism}\label{classInitializer_secInitializerMechanism}
In C++, there is currently no way to guarantee the order into which the static initialization (variables) in various modules will be done.

The \hyperlink{classInitializer}{Initializer} template class provide a way to perform a static initialization across multiple modules in an ordered fashion, thus solving potential dependency problems between initialisation. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
Initializer.\-dox\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
