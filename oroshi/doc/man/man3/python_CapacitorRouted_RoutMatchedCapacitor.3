.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Routs two matched capacitors, C1 and C2, drawn in a capacitor matrix\&. 

Connections are put in place with reference to a given matching scheme\&. Elementary capacitor units are connected to horizontal and vertical routing tracks that represent top plates and bottom plates nets of C1 and C2 \&. Supported types of capacitors are Poly-Poly and Metal-Metal\&. Technologycal rules are provided by 350 nm AMS CMOS technology with three-four metal layers\&. Metal layers that are used for routing are placed similarly to horziontal-vertical (HV) symbolic Alliance CAD tool router, where horizontal metal channels are drawn in metal 2 and the vertical ones are in metal 3\&. Given a matrix of dimensions $ R*C $, the total number of vertical tracks is $ 2C+2 $ equivalent to $ C+1 $ couples, ensuring that every elementary capacitor is positioned between four vertical tracks, two from each side\&. In fact, every adjacent couple of these tracks represent top plates and bottom plates of C1 or C2 as shown in Figure 1\&. Layout An elementary capacitor unit can be a part of C1 or C2 according to the matching scheme\&. However, to respect common-centroid layout specifications, for C1 and C2 to be equal, the matrix number of colums and number of rows must be both even\&. Addionnally, the number of elementary capacitors dedicated to C1 must be equal to those dedicated to C2\&. These two conditions are tested in one of the class methods\&. An exception is raised if at least one of the two is not respected\&.

.SS "def __init__ (self, vRTInstance)"

.PP
A special method used to customize the class instance to an initial state in which : 
.IP "\(bu" 2
the class attirbutes describing positions and dimensions of the layout are computed in dedicated class methods,
.IP "\(bu" 2
the attributes related to the capacitor matrix are copied from the \fCCapacitorStack\fP instance\&.
.PP
.PP
Position and dimensions attributes, also refered by layout variables, in Figure 2, are defined below : 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIdevice\fP The \fBHurricane\fP AMS device onto which the layout is drawn\&. 
.br
\fIcapacitorInstance\fP Instance of \fCCapacitorStack\fP class\&. 
.br
\fIcapacitor\fP A nested list containing the matrix elements, which are \fCCapacitorUnit\fP objects\&. 
.br
\fImatchingScheme\fP A nested list, with equal dimensions as \fCcapacitor\fP attribute, containing assignements of matrix elementary units to C1 and C2, identified by 1 and 2, respectively\&. Therefore, \fCself\&.matchingScheme\fP content is a succession of 1 and 2 values, defined as \\ capacitor identifiers\&. For example, given a matrix of dimensions 2x2, the matching scheme can be $ [ [1,2], [1,2] ] or [ [2,1], [2,1] ] $\&. The first sub-list dictates that the first elementary capacitor, $ C_{00} $\&. The second element $ C_{01} $ is affected to C2 and so on\&. An immediate and obvious consequence to this, is that an error is raised if \fCself\&.matchingSchem\fP and \fCself\&.capacitor\fP dimensions are not identical or if \fCself\&.matchingScheme\fP content is different from supported capacitor identifiers, '1' and '2'\&.
.br
\fIcapacitorType\fP Supported types of capacitors are MIM and PIP only\&. An exception is raised otherwise\&. 
.br
\fIabutmentBox\fP The matrix's abutment box\&. 
.br
\fImatrxiDim\fP The matrix dimensions, also equal to \fCself\&.matchingScheme\fP nested list dimensions\&. 
.br
\fIabutmentBox_spacing\fP The spacing between elementary units in the matrix\&. It is computed in \fCCapacitorStack\fP and is reloaded in \fC\fBRoutMatchedCapacitor\fP\fP\&. \fCself\&.abutmentBox_spacing\fP includes, vertical routing tracks width and minimum allowed spacing between two adjacent ones\&. 
.br
\fIhRoutingLayer_width\fP The width of horizontal routing layers in metal 2, which connect capacitors plates to vertical routing tracks\&. 
.br
\fIvRoutingTrack_width\fP The width of vertical routing tracks in metal 3, which connects identical nets together ( ie : bottom plates of C1, top plates of C2, bottom plates of C2 and top plates of C2 )\&. 
.br
\fIhRoutingTrack_width\fP The width of horizontal routing tracks in metal 2, which connect identical vertical routing tracks together\&. 
.br
\fIminSpacing_hRoutingTrack\fP Minimum spacing between horizontal routing tracks\&. Wide metal 2 specifications are considered since metal 2 dimensions may exceed 10 $ m$\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBRemark:\fP
.RS 4
For more information about wide metal specifications, refer to ENG-183_rev8\&.pdf technology manual\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIminimumPosition\fP The ordinate of the top plate's routing layer's bottom extremity after stretching\&. 
.br
\fImaximumPosition\fP The ordinate of the top plate's routing layer's top extremity, also equivalent to the top plate's top extremity\&. 
.br
\fIvRoutingTrackXCenter\fP A nested list of ordered dictionaries, with dimensions equal to \fCself\&.matrixDim\fP, containing abcissas of vertical routing tracks\&. All sub-lists' lengths are identical and are equal to 2\&. The first and second elements describe position of top plate track and bottom plate track, respectively\&. For example, given a matrix of dimensions 2x2, \fCself\&.vRoutingTrackXCenter\fP can be [[0, 2], [4,6], [8,10]] $ \mu m$\&. Elements of this nested list have particular indexing as described in Figure 2\&.
.br
\fIhRoutingtrackYCenter\fP A nested dictonary containing two keys, \fCtopTracks\fP and \fCbottomTracks\fP\&. Each key contains as value a dictionary describing centers' ordinates of four parallel horizontal tracks\&. The reason why four tracks are needed on top and bottom positions of the matrix is that four nets are used, two for every capacitor \fCCi\fP, were \fCi\fP is in [1,2]\&. 
.br
\fIhRoutingLayerYCenter\fP A nested dicitonary containing two keys, \fCtop\fP and \fCbottom\fP\&. Each key contains as value a dictionary describing centers' ordinates of horizontal routing layers\&. 
.br
\fIvRoutingTrackDict\fP A dictionary of routing tracks top and bottom extremities ordinates\&. 
.br
\fItopPlateStretching\fP Since not only the same metal 2 layer is used to draw top/bottom plates connections to vertical tracks but also the two plates are superimposed, the top plate's routing tracks is stretched\&. \fCself\&.topPlateStretching\fP is therefore the length added to top plate's routing layer in order to avoid short circuits between top and bottom plates routing to vertical tracks since the same metal is used for both\&.
